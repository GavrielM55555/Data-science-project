# Data-science-project
In this project we will use a database that we have on vehicle features, such as: company, type, time of sale, price and more, in order to predict the prices of the vehicles and the range of the time it will take to sell them.

First we will clean the data, after that we will present the data in a graphic display from which we can learn things about the data and the vehicles. In addition, we will use UMAP AND PCA so that we can better understand the information we have and from which we can learn how to bulid the AI models.

After that, we will use models to predict the price of the vehicle and the SHAP values ​​in order to see what affects the prices of the vehicle mainly.

in addition, we will try to predict the comapny name acoording to the numrtic colums so that every buyer could look for the best comapny for is needs

And to finishת an ANN model will be built in order to predict the time of the sales and will be compared with MLP ANN model froצ Sklearn.
